- React Native Application:

## Description ðŸ“‹

- Successfully Engineered an application that facilitates a virtual interaction between end customers and retailers that sold PC hardware and software.

- The application uses Vonage APIs to provide an audio-video and chat interface between customers and retailers, helping to pull up information available for a product - including pricing, bundling, offers, availability, and promotions to provide customers with answers to every question.

This project utilized the benefits of multiple packages such as :

- react-native-async-storage/async-storage: For asynchronous storage management in React Native apps.

- react-navigation/native: For implementing navigation in React Native apps.

- axios: For making HTTP requests in React Native applications.

- react-native-firebase/app and react-native-firebase/messaging: For integrating Firebase services such as authentication and push notifications.

- react-native-gesture-handler: For handling touch gestures in React Native apps.

- react-native-reanimated and react-native-screens: For implementing smooth animations and transitions in React Native apps, particularly useful with React Navigation.

- react-native-safe-area-context: For handling safe area insets in React Native apps to ensure content displays correctly on devices with notches or rounded corners.

- opentok-react-native: For integrating the OpenTok platform with React Native applications, enabling real-time video, voice, and messaging features.
